### Class 3: Advanced Pandas and Numpy and Machine Learning
**Agenda:**
* Advanced pandas ([code](code/03_pandas.py))
* Iris exploration exercise ([solutions](code/03_iris_solutions.py))
* Intro. to Machine Learning ([slides](slides/03_ml_knn.pdf), [code](code/03_sklearn_knn.py))

**Homework:**
* Complete the advanced [Pandas homework](homework/03_pandas_homework.md) (Submit on the [Dat6-students](https://github.com/sinanuozdemir/DAT6-students) repo via a pull request)
* Continue to develop your project. If you have a dataset, explore it with pandas. If you don't have a dataset yet, you should prioritize getting the data.(Nothing to turn in for next week).
* Read this excellent article, [Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html), and be prepared to discuss it next class. (You can ignore sections 4.2 and 4.3.) Here are some questions to think about while you read:
    * In the Party Registration example, what are the features? What is the response? Is this a regression or classification problem?
    * In the interactive visualization, try using different values for K across different sets of training data. What value of K do you think is "best"? How do you define "best"?
    * In the visualization, what do the lighter colors versus the darker colors mean? How is the darkness calculated?
    * How does the choice of K affect model bias? How about variance?
    * As you experiment with K and generate new training data, how can you "see" high versus low variance? How can you "see" high versus low bias?
    * Why should we care about variance at all? Shouldn't we just minimize bias and ignore variance?
    * Does a high value for K cause over-fitting or under-fitting?

**Resources:**
* For more on Pandas plotting, read the [visualization page](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html) from the official Pandas documentation.
* To learn how to customize your plots further, browse through this [notebook on matplotlib](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fonnesbeck/Bios366/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_4-Matplotlib.ipynb) (long!) and check out the [matplotlib documentation](http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html).
* To explore different types of visualizations and when to use them, Columbia's Data Mining class has an excellent [slide deck](http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/DataMining/Columbia2011/Slides/Topic2-EDAViz.ppt).
* For a more in-depth look at machine learning, read section 2.1 (14 pages) of Hastie and Tibshirani's excellent book, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). (It's a free PDF download!)
* To learn about NumPy check out this [reference code](code/03_numpy.py)
